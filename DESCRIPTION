Description: A local haplotyping visualization toolbox to capture major patterns 
    of co-inheritance between clusters of linked variants, whilst connecting findings 
    to phenotypic and demographic traits across individuals. 'crosshap' enables users 
    to explore and understand genomic variation across a trait-associated region. 
    For an example of successful local haplotype analysis, see Marsh et al. (2022) 
    <doi:10.1007/s00122-022-04045-8>.
