build_mid_dotplot(HapObject, hide_labels)

A ggplot2 object.

\description{
build_mid_dotplot() builds a central dot plot displaying the relationship
between haplotype combinations and the characteristic marker group alleles
that define them. Makes use of the $Hapfile information from a haplotype
object. This is an internal function called by crosshap_viz(), though can
be called separately to build a stand-alone plot (can be useful when patched
to a a peripheral plot).
