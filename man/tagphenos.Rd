\title{Calculate SNP phenotypic associations}
\usage{
tagphenos(MGfile, bin_vcf, pheno)
}
\arguments{
\item{MGfile}{SNP marker groups clustered using DBscan.}

\item{bin_vcf}{Binary VCF for region of interest reformatted by
run_haplotyping().}

\item{pheno}{Input numeric phenotype data for each individual.}
}
\value{
Returns intermediate of haplotype object.
}
\description{
tagphenos() reports the frequency of allele types for each SNP and calculates
phenotype associations for the different alleles, before returning this
information in a $Varfile in a HapObject. This is an internal function that
is not intended for external use.
