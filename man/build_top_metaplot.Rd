\description{
build_top_metaplot() builds a vertical stacked bar plot displaying the
frequency of each haplotype combination, broken down by each categorical
metadata variable provided. Makes use of the $Indfile information from a
haplotype object. This is an in internal function called by crosshap_viz(),
though can be called separately to build a stand-alone plot
