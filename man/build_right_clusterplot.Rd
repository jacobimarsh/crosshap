\title{Right intra-cluster linkage plot}
\usage{
build_right_clusterplot(HapObject, epsilon, hide_labels = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{HapObject}{Haplotype object created by run_haplotyping().}

\item{epsilon}{Epsilon to visualize haplotyping results for.}

\item{hide_labels}{If TRUE, legend is hidden.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object.
}
\description{
build_right_jitterplot() builds a horizontal plot displaying the mean
pairwise R^2 linkage between each SNP and all other SNPs in its marker group,
grouped by marker group, coloured by alternate allele frequency. Makes use of
the $Varfile information from haplotyping object. It is an internal function
called by crosshap_viz(), though can be called separately to build a
stand-alone plot.
