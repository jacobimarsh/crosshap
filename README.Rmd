# crosshap

LD-based local haplotype analysis and visualization tool

## What does it do?

Given a genomic variant data for a region of interest, crosshap performs
LD-based local haplotyping. Tightly linked variants are clustered into 
Marker Groups (MGs), and individuals are grouped into local haplotypes by shared 
allelic combinations of MGs. Following this, crosshap provides a range of 
visualization options to examine relevant characteristics of the linked Marker 
Groups and local haplotypes.

## Why would I use it?

crosshap was originally designed to explore local haplotype patterns that
may underlie phenotypic variability in quantitative trait locus (QTL) regions.
It is ideally suited to complement and follow-up GWAS results (takes same 
inputs). crosshap equips users with the tools to explain why a region reported a 
GWAS hit, what variants are causal candidates, what populations are they 
present/absent in, and what the features are of those populations.

Alternatively, crosshap can simply be a tool to identify patterns of linkage
among local variants, and to classify individuals based on shared haplotypes.

Note: crosshap is designed for in-depth, user-driven analysis of inheritance 
patterns in specific regions of interest, not genome-wide scans.

## Installation

You can install the development version of crosshap from [GitHub](https://github.com/crosshap) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JacobIMarsh/crosshap")
```

## Usage

In short, a typical crosshap analysis workflow involves the following steps.
For a detailed explanation and walk through, see `Getting_started.Rmd` (coming
soon!).

  0. Read in raw inputs
``` r
read_vcf(region.vcf)
read_LD(plink.ld)
read_metadata(metadata.txt)
read_pheno(pheno.txt)
```
  1. Run local haplotyping at a range of epsilon values
``` r
run_haplotyping(vcf, LD, metadata, pheno)
```  
  2. Build clustering tree to optimize epsilon value
``` r
clustree_viz(pheno)
```  
  3. Visualize local haplotypes and Marker Groups
``` r
crosshap_viz(HapObject)
```  
  
From here you can examine haplotype and Marker Group features from the 
visualization, and export relevant information from the haplotype object.

``` r
HapObject$Indfile
HapObject$Varfile
HapObject$Hapfile
```
